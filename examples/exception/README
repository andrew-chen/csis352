There are 3 main parts to exception handling, try, catch and throw.

* an exception must be thrown in a try block and caught by a catch block
* the try block is followed by one or more catch blocks
* catch (...) catches exceptions of all types and must be the last catch
* the catch block must immediately follow the try block
* additional code between catch blocks is not allowed
* if no exception is thrown, all catch blocks are ignored
* execution resumes after the last catch block
* when an exception is thrown, control is immediately passed to a catch block
* when an exception is thrown, the remainder of the try block is ignored
* any data type can be thrown including exception classes
* once a catch block executes, the remaining catch blocks are ignored
* when an exception is thrown, the function call stack is unwound
* if a throw occurs that is not caught, the program will terminate
* exceptions can be rethrown (ex13 & ex14) for partial exception processing

--------  ----------------------------------------------------------------
ex1.cpp   simple try/catch/throw, string exception
ex2.cpp   multiple catch blocks, depends on data type thrown, demo catch ...
ex3.cpp   string exception thrown in function, caught by calling function
ex4.cpp   throws runtime_error exception, demonstrates what() method
ex5.cpp   throws range_error exception, demonstrates what() method
ex6.cpp   catches out_of_range exception thrown by string class substr method
ex7.cpp   throws length_error exception or string may throw out_of_range
ex8.cpp   catch bad_alloc exception, dynamic memory allocation
ex9.cpp   throws range_error or overflow_error.  what if no catch block?
ex10.cpp  user defined exception class, no constructor
ex11.cpp  user defined exception class, constructor takes string argument
ex12.cpp  demonstrates standard exception hierarchy
ex13.cpp  example of rethrowing an exception, same exception
ex14.cpp  example of rethrowing an exception, different exception
ex15.cpp  example of stack unwinding of exceptions
