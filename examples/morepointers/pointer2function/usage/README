Let's say we are writing a program for a group of people (for example
employees, students, or whatever).  Each person is one of four different
types that has an associated function to be executed for a person of that
type.  What this example shows is a class member being a pointer to a
function, that points to 1 of the 4 utility functions associated with
that person type.

for example:
   Person p1("John Doe",3);
   Person p2("Jane Doe",2);
   p1.UtilityFunction();
   p2.UtilityFunction();

Since John Doe is of type 3, utility function 3 will execute because
object p1's member UtilityFunction points to function 3.

Since Jane Doe is of type 2, utility function 2 will execute because
object p2's member UtilityFunction points to function 2.
