This directory contains examples using the Standard Template Library (STL).

Componenets of the STL include:
   1) containers - store data
   2) iterators - allow stepping through the data in a container
   3) algorithms - manipulate data

Containers - there are three categories of containers
   1) sequence containers (sequential containers)
         * vector
         * list
         * deque (double ended queue)
   2) container adapters
         * stack
         * queue
         * priority_queue (maintained in greatest order)
   3) associative containers
         * set
         * multiset (allow duplicate items)
         * map (key/value pairs)
         * multimap (allow duplicate keys)
         * bitset (set of bits)

Iterators - similar to pointers, they allow accessing the elements in 
   containers.  Two common operations on iterators are * and ++ which
   function just like their pointer counterparts.  Iterators can be
   used with sequence containers and associative containers, but not
   container adapters (this makes sense considering the containers in
   the container adapters category, i.e. we would not want to iterate
   through a stack, but rather push and pop).  
   
   There are two esential methods associated with containers that
   use iterators.
   1) begin() - returns an iterator to the first item in the container
   2) end() - returns an iterator immediately after the last item in
      the container
      
   There are five basic types of iterators.
   1) input iterator (istream_iterator) - returns element by element from
      the input stream
   2) output iterator (ostream_iterator) - adds element by element to the
      output stream
   3) forward iterator - access elements one by one in the forward 
      direction only
   4) bidirectional iterator - access elements one by one in either
      direction
   5) random access iterator - access elements in any order
   The type of iterator available depends on the container.
      * random access - vector, deque
      * bidirectional - list, map, multimap, set, multiset, bitset

Algorithms - there are 4 categories of algorithms
   1) nonmodifying - include among many others, binary_search and search
   2) modifying - include among many others, copy, merge, set_difference,
         set_intersection, set_union, and sort
   3) numeric - accumulate, adjacent_difference, inner_product, and 
         partial_sum
   4) heap - make_heap, pop_heap, push_heap, and sort_heap


Simple example of a container (list) and an iterator

list<int> myList;
list<int>::iterator curr;

// right now, the list is empty;
// start the iterator at the beginning of myList
curr = myList.begin();
// test for empty list
if (curr == myList.end()) // or myList.empty()
   cout << "The list is empty" << endl;

// insert five items into the list myList
for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
   // places item j at the front of the list
   // insert returns an iterator to the item just inserted
   curr = myList.insert(curr, j);

// now output each item in the list starting with the
// first item in the list; keep moving the iterator
// to the next item in the list until the end of
// the list is reached
for (curr = myList.begin(); curr != myList.end(); curr++)
   cout << *curr << " ";
cout << endl;
