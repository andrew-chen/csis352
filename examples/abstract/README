This directory shows an example of an abstract class.  The Shape class
is a base class that contains a pure virtual method (abstract method) 
Area() which does not contain an implementation.  Therefore, the Shape
class is an abstract class.  No object can be instantiated from an
abstract class.  Each derived class that inherits from an abstract class
must provide implementations for all abstract methods.  In summary,

1) every derived class from Shape must have an implementation of Area()
2) an object cannot be declared to be of type Shape

The syntax for declaring an abstract method is as follows:
   virtual Returntype MethodName(Parameterlist) const = 0;
                                    // or simply = 0 if not a const method

Therefore, the Shape class contains the following:
   virtual double Area() const = 0; // abstract method

Uses of abstract classes
* Abstract classes can force all derived classes to implement a 
  certain method.
* A pointer to an abstract class can point to any derived class.
* The abstract class can be used as an argument, thereby allowing any
  derived class to be passed to it.

Some key concepts of abstract base classes:
An abstract base class
1) by definition is a class that contains at least one pure virtual
   function.
2) is used only as the basis for derived classes and thus defines a
   minimum interface for its descendants.
3) has no instances.
4) should, in general, omit implementations except for the destructor
   and functions that provide access to private data members.  That is,
   virtual functions in an abstract base class usually should be pure.
5) must implement any virtual function that is not pure, thereby
   providing a default implementation if a derived class chooses not
   to supply its own.
